# Roblox-badge-tool

A tool to display when an user gets a badge on a game, sorted by the amount of badges each year. Great for checking user activity over time specifically older users.

## Install
``pip install matplotlib``

## Usage 
Simply paste the roblox user ID and close the pie chart when needed e.g 25056736

This tool is great for checking activity, however, please note that the proportions may be inflated if the user intentionally gets badges e.g. "Badge walk".

### Note
Please do not call anyone "Pg'ed" without clear evidence.

Some users may still play the same roblox games therefore obtaining no new badges and so this may not be clear.

May take longer for users with more badges (ratelimits).

Gets the actual date/time in which an user has obtained a badge and **NOT** the date/time the badge was made.
